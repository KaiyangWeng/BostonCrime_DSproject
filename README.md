# BostonCrime_DSproject
#### Geographic Crime Analysis (Boston)

## Problem  
Boston, like many metropolitan cities, experiences varying crime rates across different neighborhoods. Understanding these patterns can help law enforcement agencies allocate resources efficiently and perform city planning decision makings. However, raw crime data is often overwhelming and difficult to interpret. A **visual, interactive dashboard** is needed to make sense of this data.
## Introduction:  
This project presents an **interactive crime analysis dashboard** that enables users to:
- Analyze the frequency and patterns of various types of crimes.
- Explore time-based trends to determine peak hours for criminal activity.
- Provide actionable insights to law enforcement and policymakers for better decision-making.

## Benefits  
 - Real-time Data Exploration – Users can interact with crime statistics dynamically.  
 - Geospatial Visualization – Map-based representations of crime trends help identify high-risk areas.  
 - Crime Trend Analysis – Users can filter crimes by type, time of day, and location.  
 - Data-Driven Decision Making – Insights generated can inform law enforcement strategies and urban safety improvements.

## How to use the Interative Dashboard:
#### Step1: Load the Dashboard
Open 'Interactive_Dashboard_Sankey_Diagram' folder in the GitHub and then download all the files inside and crime2023.csv as well. Furthermore, open Bokeh_matplotlib_sankey_dashboard.py file and run it. Once loaded, Dashboard can generate prperly.
